# Maintenance

> _This is normally a section for later that is used after development. This time it will be a reflection area._

**What did you do wrong, and how will you do it differently next time:** As the consumer reported, the blocks of text lokked a bit... weird. Without their input i probably would have left it unchanged. Maybe instead i can review with the consumer sooner?  
**What was the hardest part of this project:** Oh man, the chart js BY FAR was the most annyoing part of the process. I would say i figured it out now, but before it was so difficult i didnt want to continue. I think the only reason i contnued with it was because i spend like 1.5 days on it.  
**What part was the most fun to do:** The JSON. Once i was able to figure it out it was kinda fun to edit things.  
**Is there a way that I could have made this SDLC better or more comprehensive:** Maybe i should have included Jimmy and Jordan in these bits...
